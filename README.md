# GreenFullscreen
Green + button toggles fullscreen in OS X 10.8–9, like in OS X 10.10+

With apologies to all of the people who liked the old zoom button—as far as I'm concerned, this was the only good thing Apple changed in Yosemite. The old behavior never made any sense.

This SIMBL plugin backports that behavior to Mavericks. Particularly useful if you frequently switch between older Macs and newer ones.

I used Even Lucas's [FFS](https://github.com/evanlucas/FFS) as a starting point for this plugin. Thanks for that!
